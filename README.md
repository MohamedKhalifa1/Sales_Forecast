# Sales Forecast using Linear Regression

This repository contains notebooks and resources for implementing a sales forecast model using linear regression. The project is divided into several stages, each focusing on different aspects of the data processing and modeling process.

## Overview (00_overview.ipynb)

In this notebook, you'll find an introduction to the project, its objectives, and an overview of the dataset used for sales forecasting.

## Preprocessing (01_preprocessing.ipynb)

The preprocessing notebook covers data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis. This step ensures that the data is in the right format for modeling.

## Analytics (02_analytics.ipynb)

The analytics notebook delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Understanding the data helps in making informed decisions during feature engineering and modeling.

## Feature Engineering (03_feature_engineering.ipynb)

Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, and creating new features from the existing dataset to improve the model's predictive performance. This notebook explores various techniques to enhance the input data for better model training.

## Modeling (04_modeling.ipynb)

In this notebook, we build and evaluate the linear regression model for sales forecasting. We train the model on the prepared dataset and assess its performance using appropriate metrics.

## Reporting with Power BI

For reporting and visualizing the sales forecast results, Power BI is utilized. The Power BI reports provide intuitive dashboards and insights derived from the model's predictions.
